# Sentiment Analysis on MyPertamina App Reviews

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project conducted on user reviews of the **MyPertamina** application, scraped directly from the **Google Play Store**. The project was developed to fulfill the submission requirement for the **"Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning"** course by Dicoding and received a 5 star rating.

## Project Overview

* **Domain:** Customer feedback analysis
* **Objective:** Classify user reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments
* **Total Dataset:** 20,000 reviews scraped from Google Play Store
* **Language:** Bahasa Indonesia

### Data Collection

* Reviews were scraped using a custom script targeting the MyPertamina app on Google Play Store.
* A total of 20,000 review samples were collected and cleaned for analysis.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

* Text Cleaning: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
* Feature Extraction:
  * TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)
  * Embedding (for deep learning models)

### Sentiment Labeling
* Reviews were labeled using a lexicon-based approach with three categories:

  * Positive
  * Neutral
  * Negative

## Models Used

The project tested three different machine learning models with varied feature extraction methods and train-test splits:

| Model | Feature Extraction | Data Split | Training Accuracy | Testing Accuracy |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| ANN   | TF-IDF             | 80:20      | 97%             | 89%            |
| SVM   | TF-IDF             | 70:30      | 99%             | 88%            |
| LSTM  | Embedding          | 90:10      | 97%             | 92%            |
